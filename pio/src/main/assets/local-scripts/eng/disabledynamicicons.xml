            <desc>Select the apps you want to disable animated icons for below, and they will be automatically disabled during subsequent installation. Please choose as needed, if you need to disable all, please use the Disable All below, it is not recommended to use the Select All function in the list (it will reduce the installation efficiency). The list will show all apps, which does not mean that the apps that appear in the list use dynamic icons.
Emphasize again, choose as needed, do not select all!</desc>
